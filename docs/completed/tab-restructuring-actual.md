# Tab Restructuring - What Was Actually Implemented

This document describes what was actually implemented from the tab restructuring plan.

## Final Tab Structure

The app now has 5 tabs:
1. **Home** - Main dashboard
2. **Chat** - Messages between partners
3. **Rewards** - Points and badges display
4. **Activity** - Timeline of events
5. **More** - Settings and additional screens

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Phase 1: Simple Renames
- **Messages → Chat**: File renamed, all references updated
- **Timeline → Activity**: File renamed, all references updated
- **Icons Updated**: MessageCircle for Chat, Activity icon for Activity

### ✅ Phase 2: Partial Rewards Tab
- **Created rewards.tsx**: New file with tab implementation
- **Points Display**: Shows favor points and appreciation points by category
- **Badges Gallery**: Displays earned badges grouped by category
- **Tab Navigation**: Added to tab bar with Trophy icon

### ✅ Phase 7: More Tab (Modified from Plan)
The plan suggested replacing Profile with More, which was implemented:
- **More tab created**: Uses Menu icon (hamburger)
- **Sections implemented**:
  - Account & Profile
  - Analytics & Progress  
  - Notifications & Reminders
  - Goals & Nudges
  - Tools & Features
  - Help & Support
  - About & Legal

## What Was NOT Implemented

### ❌ Achievements System
- **No achievements table** in database
- **Achievements in UI are calculated on-the-fly** from events table
- **No persistent achievement storage**
- **No achievement notifications or rewards**

### ❌ Enhanced Activity Features
- **No summary components** with weekly stats
- **No relationship insights** (response rate, patterns)
- **No smart prompts engine**
- **No enhanced timeline grouping** (just chronological list)

### ❌ Analytics Integration
- Analytics remains a **separate screen under (more)**
- **Not integrated into profile** as planned
- Accessible via More → Analytics & Progress

## Current Implementation Details

### Rewards Tab Structure
```
Rewards Screen
├── Header with Help Icon
├── Tab Selector (Badges | Achievements)
├── Points Balance Card
│   ├── Favor Points
│   └── Appreciation Points by Category
├── Category Filter
└── Badge/Achievement Grid
```

### More Tab Structure
```

├── Quick Profile Card
├── Menu Sections
│   ├── Account & Profile → Links to profile screen
│   ├── Analytics & Progress → Links to analytics screen
│   └── Other sections with sub-items
└── Logout Button
```

### Navigation Flow
- Profile is now at `/(more)/profile` not `/(tabs)/profile`
- Analytics is at `/(more)/analytics` not integrated into profile
- All (info) screens moved to (more) group

## Key Differences from Plan

1. **Achievements**: Displayed but not stored in database
2. **Profile Location**: Under More tab, not main tab
3. **Analytics Location**: Separate screen, not integrated
4. **Activity Tab**: Basic timeline, no enhancements
5. **Database**: No new tables created
