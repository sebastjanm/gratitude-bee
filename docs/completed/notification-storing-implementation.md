# Notification Storage Implementation Status

This document compares the planned notification storage features with what has been implemented.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### 1. Database Schema
**Status: Implemented with modifications**

The `notifications` table exists in production with:
- ‚úÖ id, recipient_id, sender_id, type, content, created_at
- ‚ùå `read` boolean field ‚Üí ‚úÖ Implemented as `read_at` timestamp instead
- ‚úÖ Foreign key constraints to users table
- ‚úÖ RLS policies (need to verify exact policies)

### 2. Store Notifications in Database
**Status: Fully Implemented**

The `send-notification` function now:
- Creates a notification record before sending push
- Stores title, body, and original content in database
- Returns notification ID for use in push payload

### 3. Interactive Notification Categories
**Status: Fully Implemented**

In `utils/pushNotifications.ts`:
- ‚úÖ 'appreciation' category with "‚ù§Ô∏è Say Thanks & Open" action
- ‚úÖ 'favor_request' category with Accept/Decline actions
- ‚úÖ Additional categories for other notification types

### 4. Global Notification Listener
**Status: Fully Implemented**

In `NotificationProvider.tsx`:
- ‚úÖ Handles all notification interactions
- ‚úÖ Marks notifications as read (using read_at timestamp)
- ‚úÖ Routes to appropriate modals based on category
- ‚úÖ Handles special actions like 'thank-you-action'

### 5. UI and Helper Functions
**Status: Mostly Implemented**

- ‚úÖ Modal screens for all notification types (appreciation, favor, ping, etc.)
- ‚úÖ `send-thank-you` function implemented
- ‚ùå `mark-notification-read` function exists but uses old 'read' boolean field
- ‚úÖ NotificationProvider handles marking as read inline (sets read_at)

## üìù Key Differences from Plan

1. **read_at vs read**: Implementation uses timestamp instead of boolean, providing more information

2. **Inline vs Separate Function**: Marking notifications as read is done directly in NotificationProvider rather than calling a separate function

3. **Generic Modal Pattern**: Instead of AppreciationDetailModal, all modals follow a standardized pattern with payload parsing

4. **More Categories**: Implementation includes additional categories beyond the plan (hornet, wisdom, dont_panic)

## ‚ùå Not Implemented

### Phase 4: In-App Notification Center
**Status: Not Implemented**

The notification center feature has not been implemented. See `/docs/todo/notification-center.md` for detailed implementation requirements.

## Conclusion

The notification storage system has been successfully implemented with improvements over the original plan. The only missing feature is the in-app notification center for viewing history, which has been documented as a future todo item.
