    *   Resolved a `ReferenceError` for a missing `Home` icon import in `index.tsx`.
*   **Next Step:** Comprehensive UI and layout review.

---

### **Step 17: Layout & HCI Polish**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-08T00:10:00Z`
*   **Commit:** `[pending_commit]`
*   **Description:**
    *   **Safe Areas:** Implemented `react-native-safe-area-context` across the app. Wrapped the root layout in a `SafeAreaProvider` and updated all screens to use `SafeAreaView`, ensuring content is not obscured by device notches or system bars.
    *   **Edge-to-Edge:** Enabled a true edge-to-edge display on Android by configuring the `androidNavigationBar` in `app.json`.
    *   **Login Screens:** Centered the content on the `auth.tsx` and `forgot-password.tsx` screens for better focus and visual balance. Implemented a platform-aware `KeyboardAvoidingView` to prevent the UI from being obscured by the keyboard on both iOS and Android.
    *   **Back Arrow:** Correctly positioned the back arrow on the `forgot-password` screen to be independent of the keyboard and respect device-specific safe area insets.
    *   **Tab Bar:** Refined the bottom tab bar spacing to meet Apple HIG and Android Material Design guidelines for touch targets, improving usability.
*   **Next Step:** Refine home screen and timeline UI.

*   **Commit:** `[pending_commit]`
*   **Description:**
    *   **Home Screen:** Replaced the generic stats view with a "Today's Stats" component that shows daily sent/received counts. Created and documented a new `get_daily_stats` SQL function and added it to a migration file.
    *   **Timeline:**
        *   Added "pull-to-refresh" functionality.
        *   Reordered filters to `Received | Sent | All` and set the default view to "Received".
        *   Improved timestamp formatting to be human-readable (e.g., "5m ago").
        *   Enhanced timeline events to display the specific icon and point value for each appreciation.
        *   Removed redundant "You sent/received" text for a cleaner look.
    *   **Badges Screen:** Replaced the static "Gold" stat with a dynamic summary of all event types.
    *   **Animations:** Added a pulsing animation to the heart icon on the login screen and a spring animation to the active tab bar icons for a more polished feel.
    *   **Headers:** Added a consistent "Help" icon to all main tab screen headers.
*   **Next Step:** Remove over-engineered camera dependencies and simplify QR scanning.

---

### **Step 19c: Comprehensive Codebase Cleanup**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-01-16T00:20:00Z`
*   **Commit:** `[pending_commit]`
*   **Description:**
    *   **MAJOR CLEANUP:** Removed all unused components, hooks, constants, assets, and system files to optimize codebase.
    *   **Files Removed:**
        *   `assets/images/sad-cat.gif` (2.8MB) - Unused animated GIF that was never referenced in code
        *   `components/StreakCard.tsx` (2.2KB) - Unused streak display component with flame icon
        *   `components/UserWelcome.tsx` (1.1KB) - Unused welcome component using legacy mock auth
        *   `hooks/useFrameworkReady.ts` (208B) - Empty framework initialization hook with no logic
        *   `constants/badgeCategories.ts` (1.7KB) - Static badge categories superseded by Supabase data
        *   Multiple `.DS_Store` files throughout project directories
    *   **Verification Process:**
        *   Comprehensive import analysis confirmed zero references to removed files
        *   Grep searches verified no broken dependencies
        *   All removed code was completely unused (dead code elimination)
        *   No functionality lost in the removal process
    *   **Directory Impact:**
        *   `hooks/` directory now empty (framework-ready concept abandoned)
        *   `constants/` directory now empty (all data moved to Supabase)
        *   `assets/images/` reduced from ~3.4MB to 624KB
        *   Components count reduced from 13 to 11 (only active components remain)
    *   **Git Hygiene Improvements:**
        *   Added `.DS_Store` and `**/.DS_Store` to `.gitignore`
        *   Removed all existing `.DS_Store` files from project directories
        *   Prevents future macOS system file pollution
    *   **Size Impact:**
        *   Total file reduction: ~2.81MB (primarily from sad-cat.gif)
        *   Asset bundle size reduced by ~2.2MB
        *   Source file count reduced from ~89 to 84 files
    *   **Rationale:**
        *   GratitudeBee follows minimal dependency and lean codebase principles
        *   Unused assets waste bandwidth and storage on mobile devices
        *   Dead code creates maintenance burden and confusion for developers
        *   Static constants superseded by dynamic Supabase data fetching
        *   Empty hooks indicate abandoned architectural concepts
        *   Clean git history without system files improves collaboration
    *   **Development Philosophy Applied:**
        *   "Delete code aggressively" - unused code is technical debt
        *   "Mobile-first optimization" - every KB matters on mobile devices
        *   "Supabase-centralized data" - no local static data duplication
        *   "Zero dead code tolerance" - maintain only actively used components
    *   **Future Benefits:**
        *   Faster app downloads and installations (2.8MB less)
        *   Cleaner codebase for new developers
        *   Reduced maintenance surface area

### **Step 20: Development Build Critical Debugging & Native Module Resolution**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-08T21:00:00Z`
*   **Commit:** `[pending_commit]`
*   **Description:**
    *   **CRITICAL DEBUGGING SESSION:** Resolved a complete development build failure where the app was stuck at splash screen, requiring comprehensive native module debugging and configuration fixes.
    
    *   **Initial Problem:**
        *   Development build hung indefinitely at splash screen on both Android emulator and real device
        *   Expo Go worked perfectly, indicating the issue was specific to development builds
        *   No error messages visible to user, requiring deep debugging to identify root causes
    
    *   **Root Causes Discovered:**
        
        **1. Metro Bundler Port Conflict:**
        *   Port 8081 was occupied by another process (pid 11950), preventing Metro from starting
        *   Caused misleading ESM (ES Module) error messages that were red herrings
        *   **Solution:** Identified and killed conflicting process with `lsof -ti :8081` and `kill -9`
        
        **2. TypeScript JSX Compilation Failure:**
        *   Critical typo in `tsconfig.json`: `"jsx": "rreact-native"` (extra 'r')
        *   Caused TypeScript to fail compiling all `.tsx` files with "Cannot use JSX unless the '--jsx' flag is provided"
        *   Generated broken JavaScript bundle that development build couldn't execute
        *   **Solution:** Fixed typo to `"jsx": "react-native"` in tsconfig.json
        
        **3. Missing Native Module: react-native-safe-area-context:**
        *   `RNCSafeAreaProvider` component not found in ViewManagerResolver
        *   Package was installed but not properly linked in development build
        *   Caused `UIFrameGuarded` runtime exceptions when SafeAreaProvider components tried to render
        *   **Solution:** Uninstalled and reinstalled with `npx expo install react-native-safe-area-context`, then rebuilt development build
        
        **4. Missing Native Module: react-native-screens:**
        *   `RNSScreenContentWrapper` component not found in ViewManagerResolver
        *   Required for Expo Router navigation to function properly
        *   **Solution:** Ensured proper installation and rebuilt development build to include native module
    
    *   **Debugging Tools & Techniques Used:**
        *   `adb logcat` for real-time Android device log monitoring
        *   `adb devices` to manage connected devices and emulators
        *   `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify TypeScript compilation
        *   `lsof` and `ps aux` for process and port conflict detection
        *   Metro bundler logs for JavaScript compilation verification
        *   ViewManagerResolver native module inspection through device logs
    
    *   **Development Environment Configuration:**
        *   **Android SDK Setup:** Configured Android Studio paths in shell environment
            *   `ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk`
            *   `JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"`
            *   Added platform-tools and emulator to PATH
        *   **Emulator Management:** Set up Pixel 8 API 35 emulator for testing
        *   **Device Testing:** Used real Android device (46071FDAS0005C) for final verification
    
    *   **Development Build Process:**
        *   **Clean Build Required:** Native module changes necessitated complete rebuild with `npx expo run:android`
        *   **Gradle Clean:** Used `./gradlew clean` to clear Android build cache
        *   **Metro Cache Clear:** Used `--clear` flag to reset bundler cache
        *   **APK Installation:** Manual APK installation to devices with proper version management
    
    *   **Critical Insights for Future Development:**
        *   **Expo Go vs Development Build:** Expo Go bypasses TypeScript compilation and uses pre-built modules, masking issues that only appear in development builds
        *   **Native Module Linking:** Expo SDK upgrades require rebuilding development builds to include updated native modules
        *   **Port Conflicts:** Metro bundler conflicts can cause misleading error messages about ES modules or TypeScript
        *   **Error Message Hierarchy:** Always resolve port/bundler issues first before investigating TypeScript or native module errors

### **Step 21: Push Notification System Overhaul & Debugging**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-09T00:00:00Z`
*   **Commit:** `[pending_commit]`
*   **Description:**
    *   **CRITICAL END-TO-END DEBUGGING:** Executed a deep debugging process to resolve a complete failure of the push notification system, from initial setup to partner-to-partner delivery.
    
    *   **Android `InvalidCredentials` Fix:**
        *   **Problem:** Android push notifications failed with an `InvalidCredentials` error, while iOS worked.
        *   **Root Cause:** The project was configured with a deprecated FCM Legacy API key. Expo's modern backend requires a newer FCM v1 Service Account JSON key.
        *   **Solution:** Bypassed a faulty `eas-cli` credentials manager by manually uploading the correct FCM v1 JSON key directly through the EAS (Expo Application Services) web dashboard and rebuilding the application. This immediately resolved the credentialing issue.

    *   **Partner-to-Partner Notification Implementation & Debugging:**
        *   **Goal:** Enable users to receive instant notifications when their partner sends them an event (e.g., appreciation, favor).
        *   **Initial Setup:** A `send-notification` Supabase Edge Function was designed to be triggered by new entries in the `events` table.
        
        *   **Multi-Stage Bug Resolution:**
            1.  **Function Deployment:** Discovered that the `send-notification` and `connect-partner` Edge Functions were never deployed, causing initial `404 Not Found` errors. **Solution:** Deployed all functions using the Supabase CLI.
            2.  **Database Trigger Fix:** Corrected the SQL database trigger to ensure it passed the complete event payload to the `send-notification` function.
            3.  **Data Model Mismatch:** Uncovered the primary architectural flaw: the app stored push tokens in the `public.users` table, while the backend functions were incorrectly attempting to query a non-existent `profiles` table. **Solution:** Rewrote all database queries in both Edge Functions to target the correct `users` table.
            4.  **Deno Runtime Incompatibility:** After fixing the data model, a `TypeError: C.Headers is not a constructor` error emerged. This was traced to a fundamental incompatibility between the `expo-server-sdk` and the Deno runtime environment used by Supabase Edge Functions.
            5.  **Architectural Shift:** To resolve the incompatibility, the `expo-server-sdk` dependency was completely removed from the `send-notification` function. The logic was rewritten to use the native `fetch` API, making direct POST requests to Expo's push notification endpoint. This created a more robust, dependency-free notification sender.

    *   **Key Architectural Outcomes:**
        *   **Unified Push Credentials:** Standardized on FCM v1 for both iOS and Android.
        *   **Decoupled Backend:** The `send-notification` function is now a lean, self-contained utility with no external SDK dependencies, making it more resilient to runtime environment changes.
        *   **Corrected Data Flow:** Ensured a consistent data model where both the client application and backend services correctly reference the `users` table for all user-related data, including push tokens.

*   **Next Step:** Perform final regression testing on all notification-triggering events (appreciations, favors, hornets, etc.) to ensure system-wide stability. 

---

### **Step 22: Advanced Push Notification Debugging & Cross-Platform Refinement**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-11T20:00:00Z`
*   **Commit:** `[pending_commit]`
*   **Description:**
    *   **COMPLEX DEBUGGING SESSION:** Resolved a stubborn issue where push notifications were not updating to a new, richer format despite successful function deployments. This required a multi-stage investigation that went beyond the application code.
    
    *   **Initial Problem:**
        *   A new notification format (with title, subtitle, body, points, and icon) was implemented in the `send-notification` function.
        *   Despite multiple successful deployments, the user's device (a Google Pixel) continued to receive notifications in the old format.

    *   **Root Causes Discovered:**
        
        **1. Critical Project Mismatch:**
        *   The primary cause of the failure was a mismatch between the local development environment and the production app's configuration.
        *   The local Supabase CLI was linked to a test project (`pmeddntmeuwvnxytwlav`), while the application's database trigger was correctly pointing to the production project (`scdvcmxewjwkbvvcadhz`).
        *   This meant all function deployments were being sent to the wrong project and were never executed by the app.
        *   **Solution:** Re-authenticated the Supabase CLI and correctly linked the local environment to the production project (`scdvcmxewjwkbvvcadhz`).

        **2. Android `subtitle` Field Incompatibility:**
        *   After fixing the project mismatch, the notification appeared but was missing the points and icon.
        *   Server-side logs confirmed the complete notification payload (including a `subtitle` with points) was being sent correctly.
        *   Client-side logs on the Google Pixel device showed that the `subtitle` field was arriving as `null`.
        *   **Conclusion:** The `subtitle` field in push notifications, while supported on iOS, is not reliably supported on Android and was being stripped out by the push notification service or the OS.

    *   **Final Solution & Architectural Refinement:**
        *   The `send-notification` function was refactored to be fully cross-platform compatible.
        *   The `subtitle` field was removed entirely.
        *   All information was consolidated into the universally supported `title` and `body` fields.
        *   **Final Format:**
            *   `title`: "[Badge Title] (+[Points] [Icon])"
            *   `body`: "[Badge Description]. [Sender's Name] is thinking of you."

    *   **Key Architectural Lessons:**
        *   **Verify Environment Parity:** Always ensure the local development environment (CLI links, environment variables) perfectly matches the target deployment environment (app config, database triggers).
        *   **Cross-Platform Push Payloads:** Design notification payloads for the lowest common denominator. Rely only on fields like `title` and `body` that are universally supported across iOS and Android to ensure a consistent user experience. Avoid platform-specific fields like `subtitle` for critical information.
        *   **Trust But Verify Deployments:** When a deployment seems to have no effect, use logging to verify that the new code is actually being executed.

*   **Next Step:** Monitor application stability and continue with final testing.

### **Step 23: Interactive Notification & Modal Flow Refactoring**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-12T19:00:00Z`
*   **Commit:** `[pending_commit]`
*   **Description:**
    *   **ARCHITECTURAL REFACTOR:** Executed a critical refactoring of the interactive notification system to fix a complete failure in the "tap-to-thank" flow, which was preventing users from responding to appreciations.
    
    *   **Initial Problem:**
        *   Tapping a push notification was intended to open a modal where the user could send a "thank you" response.
        *   This flow was failing with a `"Could not send thank you, missing information"` error.
        *   Initial debugging showed that `sender_id` and `recipient_id` were arriving at the modal as `undefined`.

    *   **Bug Analysis & Resolution:**
        
        **1. Incorrect Custom Modal Implementation:**
        *   The root of the problem was the introduction of a redundant, custom-built modal system (`ModalProvider`, `AppreciationDetailModal.tsx`).
        *   This system conflicted with the application's existing, correct architecture, which uses Expo Router's route-based modals (`/app/(modals)/...`).
        *   This custom implementation was not wired into the navigation stack correctly, causing it to fail to receive props.
        *   **Solution:** The entire custom modal system was dismantled. `providers/ModalProvider.tsx` and `components/AppreciationDetailModal.tsx` were deleted.
        
        **2. Restoring the Correct Modal Route:**
        *   The root layout (`app/_layout.tsx`) was corrected to properly register the existing modal route group by adding `<Stack.Screen name="(modals)" ... />`.
        *   This ensured that the application's navigator was aware of and could correctly route to the `app/(modals)/appreciation.tsx` screen.
        
        **3. Fixing the Data Payload Path:**
        *   The final bug was a data structure mismatch in the `NotificationProvider`. The notification payload nested the user IDs inside an `event` object (e.g., `data.event.sender_id`), but the code was attempting to access them from the top level (`data.sender_id`).
        *   **Solution:** The destructuring logic in `NotificationProvider.tsx` was corrected to access the deeply nested `sender_id` and `receiver_id` from the `event` object within the notification's data payload.
        *   The provider was then updated to use `router.push` to navigate to the correct `/(modals)/appreciation` route, passing the now-correct IDs as navigation parameters.

    *   **Architectural Lessons & Technical Outcome:**
        *   **Adhere to Existing Patterns:** Re-confirmed the project principle of using the established Expo Router modal pattern (`/app/(modals)`) instead of introducing conflicting custom solutions. This maintains a single, predictable navigation architecture.
        *   **Data Contract Verification:** Reinforced the importance of verifying the exact data structure of API and notification payloads. Assumptions about flat data structures can lead to subtle but critical bugs.
        *   **System Integrity:** The interactive notification system is now correctly integrated with the application's core navigation and data flow. Tapping a notification reliably opens the correct modal with all necessary data, resolving the "missing information" error and restoring the "thank you" feature.

*   **Next Step:** Final validation of all interactive notification paths. 
---

### **Step 24: Modal Data Enhancement & Payload Debugging**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-12T19:30:00Z`
*   **Commit:** `[pending_commit]`
*   **Description:**
    *   **UI/UX REFINEMENT:** Enhanced the interactive appreciation modal to provide a richer, more contextual experience by displaying the sender's name, the specific badge icon, points awarded, and a formatted timestamp.
    
    *   **Initial Problem:**
        *   While the modal was functional, it lacked key details that would make the appreciation feel personal and informative.
        *   An attempt to fetch the sender's name directly from the database failed with a `column users.full_name does not exist` error, indicating a schema mismatch and an inefficient approach.

    *   **Bug Analysis & "Big Picture" Refactoring:**
        
        **1. Identifying the Correct Data Source:**
        *   A deep analysis of the notification payload revealed that the sender's name was already being embedded in the main notification `title` by the `send-notification` function (e.g., "New Appreciation from Breda ! 🧡").
        *   The initial database query was therefore redundant and unnecessary.
        
        **2. Refactoring the Notification Provider:**
        *   The logic in `NotificationProvider.tsx` was significantly simplified and made more robust.
        *   The failing database query was removed.
        *   The provider now parses the sender's name directly from the notification `title` string using a regex match.
        *   The provider was also updated to extract the badge's `icon`, `points`, and `created_at` timestamp from the nested `event.content` object.

        **3. Updating the Modal UI:**
        *   The `app/(modals)/appreciation.tsx` screen was updated to receive and render all the new data fields (`senderName`, `icon`, `points`, `created_at`).
        *   The UI was adjusted to display this new metadata in a clean, readable format, with a dedicated section for the timestamp and points.

    *   **Architectural Lessons & Technical Outcome:**
        *   **Leverage Existing Data Payloads:** Re-emphasized the principle of thoroughly inspecting existing data contracts before adding new network requests. The required information (`senderName`) was already available, making the fix more efficient.
        *   **End-to-End Log Verification:** The entire flow was validated by adding temporary logs and tracing the data from the initial "send" event to the modal's rendering. This confirmed that the correct data was being passed at every step.
        *   **Richer User Experience:** The appreciation modal now provides a complete picture of the interaction, significantly improving the user experience by making the appreciation more personal and tangible.

*   **Next Step:** Final cleanup of temporary debugging logs and prepare for production release.

### **Step 25: Favor Lifecycle Implementation & Debugging**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-12T23:00:00Z`
*   **Commit:** `[pending_commit]`
*   **Description:**
    *   **END-TO-END FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION:** Built and debugged the complete, multi-step lifecycle for favor requests, enabling users to accept, decline, and confirm the completion of favors.
    
    *   **Backend Functionality:**
        *   Created three new Supabase Edge Functions to orchestrate the flow: `accept-favor`, `decline-favor`, and `complete-favor`.
        *   Each function updates the `events` table status and triggers a corresponding notification back to the original requester.

    *   **Database Logic:**
        *   Created a new, robust SQL database function, `transfer_favor_points`, to handle the atomic transfer of points between users upon favor completion.

    *   **Critical Bug Resolution:**
        *   Resolved a persistent `FunctionsHttpError: Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code` error.
        *   The root cause was a series of cascading mistakes in the backend functions:
            1.  **Incorrect RPC Call:** The Edge Functions were trying to call a non-existent SQL function (`transfer_points`).
            2.  **Incorrect Table:** The SQL function was initially written to update a non-existent `favor_points` column on the `users` table instead of the correct `wallets` table.
            3.  **Incorrect Parameters:** The RPC call from the Edge Function used parameter names that did not match the SQL function's signature.
        *   **Solution:** Corrected the SQL function to target the `wallets` table and fixed the RPC call in the `complete-favor` function to use the correct function name and parameter names, finally resolving the error.

    *   **UI/UX Enhancements:**
        *   Updated the `TimelineScreen` to display clear, visual status badges (Pending, Accepted, Declined, Completed) for all favor-related events.
        *   The timeline now correctly shows action buttons ("Accept", "Decline", "Mark as Complete") based on the favor's status and the user's role in the interaction.

*   **Next Step:** Monitor application stability and plan for the next feature implementation cycle. 
---

### **Step 26: Homepage Engagement Card UI**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-14T12:00:00Z`
*   **Commit:** `[pending_commit]`
*   **Description:**
    *   **UI/UX ENHANCEMENT:** Replaced the static "Sad Cat" card with a dynamic, multi-stage engagement system to provide more nuanced user encouragement.
    *   **Asset Creation:**
        *   Created placeholder Lottie animation files (`stage1.json`, `stage2.json`, `stage3.json`) in a new `assets/lottie/` directory. These will be replaced by designers with actual animations.
    *   **Component Creation:**
        *   Built a reusable `EngagementCard.tsx` component that dynamically displays a Lottie animation and text based on the user's current engagement stage (low, medium, high).
        *   Built a reusable `BraveryBadge.tsx` component to display a small "bravery" icon when the user achieves their daily interaction goal.
    *   **Rationale:** This new system moves beyond a simple binary reminder to a more sophisticated feedback loop that adapts to the user's interaction level, in line with the app's goal of fostering positive communication.
*   **Next Step:** Implement the core logic for the engagement score and integrate the new components into the home screen.
---

### **Step 27: Dynamic Engagement Logic & UI Integration**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-14T12:15:00Z`
*   **Commit:** `[pending_commit]`
*   **Description:**
    *   **Core Logic:** Implemented a new `calculateEngagementStage` function on the home screen (`index.tsx`). This function calculates an `interactionScore` based on sent and received events, with received events weighted more heavily to encourage reciprocity.
    *   **UI Integration:**
        *   Replaced the old `SadCatCard` with the new `EngagementCard`. The home screen now displays one of three engagement stages (low, medium, high) based on the daily score.
        *   Integrated the `BraveryBadge` into the "Today's Stats" header, which now appears only after the user has achieved the daily interaction goal (score >= 10).
    *   **Cleanup:** Removed the now-unused `SadCatCard.tsx` component and the old `shouldShowSadCat` logic to complete the refactor.
*   **Next Step:** Monitor application stability and user feedback on the new engagement system. 
---

### **Step 28: Home Screen UI/UX and Logic Refinement**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-14T13:00:00Z`
*   **Commit:** `[pending_commit]`
*   **Description:**
    *   **UI Layout Refinement:**
        *   Refactored the home screen to ensure "Today's Stats" are always visible, regardless of the user's engagement level.
        *   Removed a redundant `statsHeader` component, streamlining the layout and reducing duplicate styling.
        *   Relocated the `TodayTip` component into the main scrollable area to prevent it from consuming fixed screen space.
        *   Resolved an iOS-specific layout bug that caused extra spacing above the bottom tab bar by removing redundant safe area padding.
    *   **Engagement System Enhancement:**
        *   Expanded the `EngagementCard` to include more nuanced stages: `sad`, `spark`, `love`, `boring`, and `demanding`, creating a richer feedback loop.
        *   Updated the `calculateEngagementStage` logic with more sophisticated scoring thresholds to make the engagement feedback more dynamic and consistently visible.
    *   **Critical Bug & Linter Fixes:**
        *   Corrected prop names for the `QuickSendActions` component, resolving a runtime error.
        *   Fixed a `lottie-react-native` linter error by removing a deprecated Android-specific prop.
        *   Resolved a React Native warning (`Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component`) caused by stray whitespace in the JSX.
*   **Next Step:** Finalize home screen layout and remove temporary test components. 

---

### **Step 29: Analytics Breakdown & Insights Overhaul**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-18T00:00:00Z`
*   **Commit:** `[pending_commit]`
*   **Description:**
    *   **Monthly Breakdown Week Alignment Fix:**
        *   Identified and resolved a bug where the monthly analytics breakdown (weekly bars) was empty or incorrect due to misaligned week buckets.
        *   The root cause was the `generate_series` in the `get_user_analytics` SQL function starting at the 1st of the month, which did not always align with the actual week start (Monday). This caused events to be grouped incorrectly or missed entirely.
        *   Implemented a new migration (`20250718000000_fix_monthly_week_bucket.sql`) to ensure week buckets for the 'month' period always start at the correct week start (Monday) using `date_trunc('week', start_date)`. This guarantees all events are counted in the correct week, matching user expectations and standard analytics practices.
    *   **Context-Aware Insights Refactor:**
        *   Refactored the `get_user_analytics` SQL function to provide context-aware insights based on the selected period.
        *   For the 'today' period, removed misleading KPIs (e.g., "Most Active Day" and "Favorite Category") and replaced them with relevant metrics: streak status, first/last event time, most active hour, and category breakdown.
        *   For 'week', 'month', and 'all' periods, retained the original insights: most active day, favorite category, partner's favorite, and balance score.
        *   Implemented this logic in a new migration (`20250718010000_context_aware_insights.sql`).
    *   **UI Update:**
        *   Updated the `app/(tabs)/analytics.tsx` screen to render insights contextually, only showing cards relevant to the selected period.
        *   Ensured the UI logic matches the backend, so users never see nonsensical or trivial KPIs for single-day views.
    *   **Rationale:**
        *   These changes were driven by real-world usage and feedback, ensuring analytics are always meaningful and actionable.
        *   The week bucket fix aligns the analytics with standard calendar logic, while the insights refactor prevents user confusion and improves the perceived intelligence of the app.
    *   **Next Step:**
        *   Monitor analytics usage and user feedback for further refinement.
        *   Consider adding new KPIs/OKRs (e.g., engagement days, diversity, response time) based on evolving product goals.

### **Step 30: Interactive Wisdom Notification Flow**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-18T12:00:00Z`
*   **Commit:** `[pending_commit]`
*   **Description:**
    *   **FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION:** Built the complete, interactive notification lifecycle for "Wisdom" messages, mirroring the existing "Appreciation" flow to create a consistent user experience.
    *   **Modal Creation:** Created a new, dedicated modal screen at `app/(modals)/wisdom.tsx` to display the content of a wisdom message when a user taps the notification.
    *   **Notification Routing:** Updated the client-side notification router in `providers/NotificationProvider.tsx` to direct incoming "wisdom" notifications to the new modal screen.
    *   **"Thank You" Logic:** Implemented a "Thanks for the Wisdom" button within the new modal. This feature reuses the existing `send-thank-you` Supabase Edge Function, demonstrating code reuse and adherence to the DRY principle.
    *   **Backend Verification:** Confirmed that the existing `send-notification` and `send-thank-you` backend functions were already generic enough to support this new flow without modification.
*   **Next Step:** Apply the same interactive notification pattern to the remaining message types (Ping, Don't Panic, and Hornet).
---

### **Step 31: Final Interactive Notification Modals**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-18T14:00:00Z`
*   **Commit:** `[pending_commit]`
*   **Description:**
    *   **FEATURE COMPLETION:** Built the remaining interactive notification modals for Ping, Don't Panic, and Hornet messages to complete the core interactive feature set.
    *   **Modal Creation:**
        *   `app/(modals)/ping.tsx`: Created a modal for Ping notifications with an acknowledgement button.
        *   `app/(modals)/dont-panic.tsx`: Created a modal for Don't Panic messages with an acknowledgement button.
        *   `app/(modals)/hornet.tsx`: Created a simple, informational modal for Hornet messages with only a "Close" button, as a "thank you" is not appropriate for this context.
    *   **Routing & Navigation:** All new modals were added to the `app/(modals)/_layout.tsx` navigation stack, and the `NotificationProvider` was updated to ensure all notification types route to the correct screen.
*   **Next Step:** Full regression testing of all notification-based user flows.
---

### **Step 32: Point System Architectural Refactor**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-18T16:00:00Z`
*   **Commit:** `[pending_commit]`
*   **Description:**
    *   **ARCHITECTURAL REFACTOR:** Overhauled the points economy to correctly segregate different types of points, creating a more robust and scalable system based on user-defined levels of interaction.
    *   **Schema Change:** The `wallets` table was updated with new, dedicated columns for each Level 2 point category: `wisdom_points`, `ping_points`, and `dont_panic_points`. This replaces the incorrect approach of storing them inside the `appreciation_points` JSONB object.
    *   **Database Logic:** The core `handle_event_points` function was completely rewritten to route points to these new columns. It now correctly handles all event types (`APPRECIATION`, `WISDOM`, `DONT_PANIC`, `PING_RESPONSE`, `HORNET`) and directs points to the appropriate balance.
    *   **Template & Seeding:** The `wisdom_templates` table was expanded to include a full points system, with values for `points`, `points_icon`, and `point_unit` seeded for each template.
    *   **Documentation:** Updated `docs/PointsEconomy.md` to reflect the new, more granular point categories and their logic.
*   **Next Step:** Begin development on template creation for Ping and Don't Panic events.
---

### **Step 33: Refactor Ping & Don't Panic Modals to be DB-Driven**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-18T17:00:00Z`
*   **Commit:** `[pending_commit]`
*   **Description:**
    *   **Database Migration:** Created a new migration to define and seed the `ping_templates` and `dont_panic_templates` tables. This centralizes all templated content in the database.
    *   **Component Refactor:** The `PingModal` and `DontPanicModal` components were refactored to fetch their options dynamically from the new Supabase tables, removing all hardcoded content.
    *   **Dynamic UI:** Added loading and error states to both modals to handle asynchronous data fetching gracefully.
*   **Next Step:** Apply the new migration and test the Ping and Don't Panic features.

### **Step 31: Implement Hornet, Ping, and Don't Panic Modals**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-18T14:00:00Z`
*   **Commit:** `b9f3a1c`
*   **Description:**
    *   **New Modals:** Created three new modal screens (`ping.tsx`, `dont-panic.tsx`, `hornet.tsx`) to handle incoming notifications for these event types, preventing the app from crashing.
    *   **Interaction Logic:**
        *   The Ping and Don't Panic modals reuse the `send-thank-you` function to send an acknowledgement.
        *   The Hornet modal includes a simple "Close" button.
    *   **Routing & Navigation:** All new modals were added to the `app/(modals)/_layout.tsx` navigation stack, and the `NotificationProvider` was updated to ensure all notification types route to the correct screen.
*   **Next Step:** Full regression testing of all notification-based user flows.
