### **Step 1: Foundational Setup**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-06T17:04:28Z`
*   **Commit:** `1324433`
*   **Description:**
    *   Established comprehensive project documentation, including a `PRD.md`, `ContentCatalog.md`, and `PointsEconomy.md`.
    *   Designed and generated a complete Supabase database schema with tables for users, events, wallets, and dynamic templates.
    *   Integrated the Supabase client into the Expo application.
    *   Implemented a session provider to manage user authentication state.

### **Step 2: Partner Connection**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-06T17:05:39Z`
*   **Commit:** `1324433`
*   **Description:**
    *   Implemented the front-end logic in `partner-link.tsx` to fetch the user's invite code and call a Supabase Function to connect with a partner.
    *   Created the `connect-partner` Supabase Edge Function to securely find and link two partner profiles based on an invite code.
    *   Updated the UI to reflect the connected state and display the partner's name.
*   **Next Step:** Build out the core "Send Appreciation" feature.

### **Step 3: Send Appreciation**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-06T17:13:30Z`
*   **Commit:** `b38a176`
*   **Description:**
    *   Refactored the `AppreciationModal` to fetch badge templates dynamically from the Supabase database, making the content admin-manageable.
    *   Implemented the `handleSendBadge` function in the `HomeScreen` to insert a new `APPRECIATION` event into the central `events` ledger.
    *   Created the `send-notification` Supabase Edge Function to automatically send a push notification to the receiving user when a new badge is sent.
*   **Next Step:** Implement the "Ask for a Favor" flow.

---

### **Step 4: Ask for a Favor**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-06T17:18:46Z`
*   **Commit:** `b38a176`
*   **Description:**
    *   Refactored the `FavorsModal` to be fully dynamic, fetching available favor templates from the Supabase database.
    *   Implemented the `handleSendFavor` function to check the user's current point balance and, if sufficient, create a `FAVOR_REQUEST` event in the ledger.
    *   Updated the `send-notification` Edge Function to handle favor requests, ensuring the receiving partner is notified.
*   **Next Step:** Implement the receiving side of favors (accepting/declining and completing).

---

### **Step 5: Favor Fulfillment**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-06T17:21:01Z`
*   **Commit:** `541a125`
*   **Description:**
    *   Corrected the `handle_event_points` database function to correctly award favor points to the receiver upon completion.
    *   Enhanced the `TimelineScreen` to display action buttons (Accept, Decline, Mark as Complete) for favor requests.
    *   The UI now conditionally renders these buttons based on the favor's status and the current user's role (receiver).
*   **Next Step:** Connect the favor action buttons to Supabase to update the event status.

---

### **Step 6: Dynamic Link Invitations**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-06T17:53:35Z`
*   **Commit:** `1acd00c`
*   **Description:**
    *   Upgraded the "Invite Partner" feature to use dynamic links (`gratitudebee.app/invite/...`) instead of raw codes.
    *   Configured the `app.json` with the necessary intent filters (Android) and associated domains (iOS) to handle these links.
    *   Created a new dynamic route `app/invite/[code].tsx` to process incoming invites, either by connecting the user automatically or redirecting them to sign up.
    *   The `partner-link.tsx` screen now checks for stored invite codes upon loading to complete the connection flow seamlessly after login.
*   **Next Step:** Implement the "Ask for a Favor" and favor fulfillment flow.

### **Step 7: Favor Flow Implementation**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-06T17:56:24Z`
*   **Commit:** `b1279d4`
*   **Description:**
    *   Made the `FavorsModal` dynamic by fetching templates from Supabase.
    *   Implemented the `handleSendFavor` function to create `FAVOR_REQUEST` events.
    *   Added action buttons to the `TimelineScreen` to allow users to accept, decline, and complete favors.
    *   Connected the timeline to Supabase, so it now displays a live, dynamic feed of all events.
*   **Next Step:** Implement the "Send Hornet" flow.

---

### **Step 8: Send Hornet**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-06T17:59:17Z`
*   **Commit:** `b1279d4`
*   **Description:**
    *   Made the `NegativeBadgeModal` dynamic by fetching hornet templates from the database.
    *   Implemented the `handleSendHornet` function to create a `HORNET` event in the ledger.
    *   Updated the `send-notification` Edge Function to handle hornet events.
*   **Next Step:** Implement the remaining message-only flows (Don't Panic, Relationship Wisdom).

---

### **Step 9: Message-Only Flows**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-06T18:02:54Z`
*   **Commit:** `b1279d4`
*   **Description:**
    *   Implemented the `handleSendDontPanic` and `handleSendWisdom` functions to create `DONT_PANIC` and `WISDOM` events in the ledger.
    *   Updated the `send-notification` Edge Function to handle these new event types, ensuring the receiving partner is notified.
*   **Next Step:** All core features are now implemented. Ready for testing and refinement.

### **Step 10: Database and UI Refinement**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-06T18:10:00Z`
*   **Commit:** `[pending_commit]`
*   **Description:**
    *   Addressed a schema design flaw by adding a `points_icon` column to the `appreciation_templates` table, decoupling the point type from the UI display.
    *   Updated the `seed.sql` script to populate the new `points_icon` column and made it idempotent to prevent errors on re-runs.
    *   Refactored `AppreciationModal.tsx` to use the dynamic `points_icon` from the database, removing the hardcoded emoji logic.
*   **Next Step:** Comprehensive testing of all event-based flows and UI components.
