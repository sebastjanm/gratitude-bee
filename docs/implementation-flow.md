*   **Commit:** `1324433`
*   **Description:**
    *   Implemented the front-end logic in `partner-link.tsx` to fetch the user's invite code and call a Supabase Function to connect with a partner.
    *   Created the `connect-partner` Supabase Edge Function to securely find and link two partner profiles based on an invite code.
    *   Updated the UI to reflect the connected state and display the partner's name.
*   **Next Step:** Build out the core "Send Appreciation" feature.

### **Step 3: Send Appreciation**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-06T17:13:30Z`
*   **Commit:** `b38a176`
*   **Description:**
    *   Refactored the `AppreciationModal` to fetch badge templates dynamically from the Supabase database, making the content admin-manageable.
    *   Implemented the `handleSendBadge` function in the `HomeScreen` to insert a new `APPRECIATION` event into the central `events` ledger.
    *   Created the `send-notification` Supabase Edge Function to automatically send a push notification to the receiving user when a new badge is sent.
*   **Next Step:** Implement the "Ask for a Favor" flow.

### **Step 4: Ask for a Favor**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-06T17:18:46Z`
*   **Commit:** `b38a176`
*   **Description:**
    *   Refactored the `FavorsModal` to be fully dynamic, fetching available favor templates from the Supabase database.
    *   Implemented the `handleSendFavor` function to check the user's current point balance and, if sufficient, create a `FAVOR_REQUEST` event in the ledger.
    *   Updated the `send-notification` Edge Function to handle favor requests, ensuring the receiving partner is notified.
*   **Next Step:** Implement the receiving side of favors (accepting/declining and completing).

### **Step 5: Favor Fulfillment**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-06T17:21:01Z`
*   **Commit:** `541a125`
*   **Description:**
    *   Corrected the `handle_event_points` database function to correctly award favor points to the receiver upon completion.
    *   Enhanced the `TimelineScreen` to display action buttons (Accept, Decline, Mark as Complete) for favor requests.
    *   The UI now conditionally renders these buttons based on the favor's status and the current user's role (receiver).
*   **Next Step:** Connect the favor action buttons to Supabase to update the event status.

### **Step 6: Invite Partner**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-06T17:46:29Z`
*   **Commit:** `541a125`
*   **Description:**
    *   Implemented the "Invite Partner" functionality on the `ProfileScreen`.
    *   The user's unique invite code is now fetched from the database.
    *   The "Invite Partner" button now uses the native Share API to allow users to easily send their invite code.
    *   The profile screen now dynamically displays the connection status and partner's name.
*   **Next Step:** Finalize the favor fulfillment flow by connecting the UI to the backend.

### **Step 7: Dynamic Link Invitations**
*   **Timestamp:** `2025-07-06T17:53:35Z`
*   **Commit:** `1acd00c`
*   **Description:**
    *   Upgraded the "Invite Partner" feature to use dynamic links (`gratitudebee.app/invite/...`) instead of raw codes.
    *   Configured the `app.json` with the necessary intent filters (Android) and associated domains (iOS) to handle these links.
    *   Created a new dynamic route `app/invite/[code].tsx` to process incoming invites, either by connecting the user automatically or redirecting them to sign up.
    *   The `partner-link.tsx` screen now checks for stored invite codes upon loading to complete the connection flow seamlessly after login.
*   **Next Step:** Finalize the favor fulfillment flow.
