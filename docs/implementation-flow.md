    *   **Timeline:**
        *   Added "pull-to-refresh" functionality.
        *   Reordered filters to `Received | Sent | All` and set the default view to "Received".
        *   Improved timestamp formatting to be human-readable (e.g., "5m ago").
        *   Enhanced timeline events to display the specific icon and point value for each appreciation.
        *   Removed redundant "You sent/received" text for a cleaner look.
    *   **Badges Screen:** Replaced the static "Gold" stat with a dynamic summary of all event types.
    *   **Animations:** Added a pulsing animation to the heart icon on the login screen and a spring animation to the active tab bar icons for a more polished feel.
    *   **Headers:** Added a consistent "Help" icon to all main tab screen headers.
*   **Next Step:** Remove over-engineered camera dependencies and simplify QR scanning.
