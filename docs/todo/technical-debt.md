## ðŸ”´ High Priority Issues

### 1. Database Performance - Missing Indexes

- **Date Identified:** 2025-08-06
- **Severity:** High
- **Status:** Pending

#### Problem Description
Critical database queries lack proper indexes, causing potential performance issues as data grows:
- `events.sender_id` and `events.receiver_id` - Used in activity feed queries
- `events.event_type` - Filtered in many queries
- `messages.conversation_id` - Critical for chat performance
- `users.partner_id` - Used in relationship queries
- `notifications.recipient_id` - Used in notification fetching

#### Impact
- Slow query performance as tables grow
- Poor user experience with loading delays
- Increased database CPU usage and costs

#### Resolution
Create indexes in a new migration file for all frequently queried columns.

### 2. React Native Performance Issues

- **Date Identified:** 2025-08-06
- **Severity:** High
- **Status:** Pending

#### Problem Description
Multiple performance anti-patterns identified:
- **Missing Memoization**: Only 3 files use React.memo, useMemo, or useCallback
- **Large Components**: HomeScreen is 1000+ lines with 10+ state variables
- **Unnecessary Re-renders**: Heavy computations in render methods
- **No Virtual Lists**: Long lists rendered without virtualization

#### Impact
- Poor app performance on older devices
- Battery drain from excessive re-renders
- Janky scrolling and UI interactions

#### Resolution
- Split large components into smaller, memoized pieces
- Implement React.memo for pure components
- Add useMemo/useCallback for expensive operations
- Use FlashList for long scrollable content

---

### 3. Error Handling Architecture

- **Date Identified:** 2025-08-06
- **Severity:** High
- **Status:** Pending

#### Problem Description
Inconsistent error handling throughout the application:
- Mix of alerts, console logs, and silent failures
- No error boundaries for component crashes
- No centralized error reporting
- Many empty catch blocks

#### Impact
- Poor user experience with cryptic error messages
- Difficult debugging in production
- Potential data loss from silent failures

#### Resolution
- Implement React Error Boundaries
- Create centralized error handling service
- Add proper logging and monitoring
- Standardize error response patterns

---

### 4. TypeScript Type Safety

- **Date Identified:** 2025-08-06
- **Severity:** High
- **Status:** Pending

#### Problem Description
Extensive use of `any` type reducing type safety:
- 25+ files contain `any` types
- Missing shared type definitions
- Inline type definitions instead of reusable interfaces
- No strict mode enabled

#### Impact
- Runtime errors that could be caught at compile time
- Reduced IDE autocomplete effectiveness
- Harder refactoring and maintenance

#### Resolution
- Enable TypeScript strict mode
- Create shared types directory
- Replace all `any` with proper types
- Add type generation from database schema

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority Issues

### 5. Code Duplication

- **Date Identified:** 2025-08-06
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Status:** Pending

#### Problem Description
Significant code duplication across components:
- Database query patterns repeated in 15+ files
- Error handling logic duplicated
- Similar modal components with slight variations
- No custom hooks for shared logic

#### Impact
- Harder maintenance with changes needed in multiple places
- Increased bundle size
- Inconsistent behavior across similar features

#### Resolution
- Create custom hooks for data fetching
- Build shared utility functions
- Implement component composition patterns
- Use React Context for shared state

---

### 6. Database Schema Issues

- **Date Identified:** 2025-08-06
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Status:** Pending

#### Problem Description
Several database design concerns:
- Inconsistent cascade policies on foreign keys
- JSONB columns without validation
- Points stored in multiple places (denormalized)
- Complex RLS policies affecting performance

#### Impact
- Data integrity risks
- Performance degradation from complex policies
- Difficult data migrations

#### Resolution
- Standardize cascade behaviors
- Add JSONB validation constraints
- Consolidate point storage logic
- Optimize RLS policies

---

### 7. Push Notification Complexity

- **Date Identified:** 2025-08-06
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Status:** Pending

#### Problem Description
Push notification logic scattered across multiple files:
- Setup code in multiple locations
- Limited retry logic for failures
- No notification queue management
- Inconsistent error handling

#### Impact
- Failed notifications without recovery
- Difficult to debug notification issues
- Poor reliability for critical notifications

#### Resolution
- Centralize notification logic
- Implement retry queue
- Add notification delivery tracking
- Create notification debugging tools

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority Issues

### 8. Redundant Supabase Realtime Publication

- **Date Identified:** Previously documented
- **Severity:** Low
- **Status:** Pending (Awaiting Supabase Support Action)

#### Problem Description
During an investigation into our Supabase Realtime setup, we discovered a redundant and undeletable publication named `supabase_realtime_messages_publication`.

This publication was likely created manually during the initial development of the chat feature. It is now obsolete because all necessary tables (`conversations`, `messages`, `conversation_participants`) are correctly managed by the standard `supabase_realtime` publication.

The core issue is that this redundant publication is owned by the internal `supabase_admin` role. Due to platform-level security restrictions, our user role (`postgres`) does not have the permissions to drop this publication.

#### Impact
- Minor performance overhead
- Schema clutter

#### Resolution Plan
Open support ticket with Supabase to remove the publication.

---

### 9. File Organization

- **Date Identified:** 2025-08-06
- **Severity:** Low
- **Status:** Pending

#### Problem Description
Inconsistent file and folder organization:
- Components mixed with screens
- No custom hooks directory
- Utils folder becoming a catch-all
- Inconsistent naming conventions

#### Impact
- Harder to find code
- Unclear architecture for new developers
- Difficult to maintain consistency

#### Resolution
- Create clear folder structure
- Move components to dedicated folders
- Extract custom hooks
- Document naming conventions

---

### 10. Testing Infrastructure

- **Date Identified:** 2025-08-06
- **Severity:** Low (but important long-term)
- **Status:** Pending

#### Problem Description
Complete absence of automated testing:
- No unit tests
- No integration tests
- No E2E tests
- No type validation for API responses

#### Impact
- High risk of regressions
- Manual testing burden
- Reduced confidence in deployments

#### Resolution
- Set up Jest for unit testing
- Add React Native Testing Library
- Implement E2E tests with Detox
- Add API response validation

## Tracking

Each item should be converted to a ticket in the project management system with:
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Estimated effort
- Assigned owner
- Target completion date

Regular technical debt review sessions should be scheduled to prevent accumulation of new debt.
