# Activity Tab Enhancements

**Status:** Not Implemented  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Complexity:** Medium

## Overview

Enhance the Activity tab (timeline) with better organization, insights, and visual improvements.

## Features to Implement

### 1. Timeline Grouping

**Current:** Simple chronological list  
**Needed:** Group by time periods

```typescript
interface TimelineGroup {
  title: string; // "Today", "Yesterday", "This Week", etc.
  events: Event[];
  specialMarkers?: {
    isMilestone?: boolean;
    isHighActivity?: boolean;
    streakAchieved?: boolean;
  };
}
```

Groups:
- Today
- Yesterday  
- This Week
- Last Week
- This Month
- Older

### 2. Activity Summary Header

Add summary component at top of timeline:

```typescript
interface ActivitySummary {
  weeklyStats: {
    sent: number;
    received: number;
    streak: number;
    favorBalance: number;
  };
  insights: string[];
  milestones: Milestone[];
}
```

### 3. Relationship Insights

#### Response Rate Tracking
- Track ping responses
- Calculate average response time
- Show improvement trends
- "Your response time improved by 20% this week!"

#### Activity Patterns
- Time of day analysis
- Day of week patterns  
- Seasonal trends
- "You're most active on Thursdays at 8 PM"

#### Balance Meter
- Giving vs receiving ratio
- Favor exchange balance
- Category preferences
- Visual balance indicator

### 4. Smart Prompts Engine

Contextual suggestions based on:
- Inactivity detection (no events in X days)
- Partner preferences
- Milestone reminders
- Special occasions

Examples:
- "You haven't sent appreciation in 3 days"
- "Your partner loves humor badges!"
- "One more appreciation to reach 100!"

### 5. Visual Enhancements

#### Special Event Markers
- üèÜ Milestone reached
- üî• Streak achievement
- ‚≠ê High activity day
- üíù Special occasions

#### Improved Event Cards
- Larger touch targets
- Better visual hierarchy
- Reaction previews
- Quick actions (reply, react)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Structure
1. Create grouping logic
2. Add date utilities
3. Build summary calculations

### Phase 2: UI Components
1. Create GroupedTimeline component
2. Build ActivitySummary header
3. Add InsightCard components

### Phase 3: Smart Features
1. Implement prompt engine
2. Add pattern detection
3. Create suggestion algorithm

### Phase 4: Polish
1. Add animations
2. Implement haptic feedback
3. Optimize performance

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Virtualized list for large timelines
- Lazy load older groups
- Cache summary data
- Debounce calculations

### State Management
- Store insights in context
- Cache grouping results
- Persist prompt dismissals

### Analytics
- Track insight engagement
- Measure prompt effectiveness
- Monitor performance impact

## UI/UX Considerations

- Maintain quick scanning ability
- Don't overwhelm with insights
- Make prompts dismissible
- Respect user preferences
- Support pull-to-refresh

## Success Metrics

- Increased daily opens
- Higher engagement with older events
- Prompt interaction rate
- Performance benchmarks
