# Notification System - Remaining Features

This document outlines notification system features from the original refactor plan that have not yet been implemented.

## Summary

The core notification system refactor has been successfully implemented. The system is now generic, extensible, and follows the planned architecture. Most of the original goals have been achieved.

## Implemented vs Planned

### ✅ Successfully Implemented

1. **Generic NotificationProvider**: 
   - Central routing system implemented
   - Category-to-route mapping working
   - Standardized payload passing complete
   
2. **Modal Screen Pattern**:
   - All modals use useLocalSearchParams
   - Payload parsing standardized
   - All current notification types have corresponding modals

3. **Server-Side Integration**:
   - send-notification function properly assigns categoryIdentifier
   - All event types mapped to categories
   - Database integration complete

4. **Interactive Actions**:
   - Thank You action implemented for appreciations
   - Accept/Decline actions prepared for favors

### ❌ Not Yet Implemented

1. **Favor Response Modals**:
   - No modal screen for 'favor_response' category
   - Would need to handle FAVOR_ACCEPTED, FAVOR_DECLINED, FAVOR_COMPLETED events
   - Currently these have categoryIdentifier set but no corresponding route

2. **Sub-category Handling**:
   - The code splits categoryIdentifier by '.' to handle sub-categories
   - This feature is not currently used (no sub-categories defined)
   - Could be useful for more granular notification routing

3. **Default Category Handling**:
   - PING_RESPONSE and REACTION events use 'default' category
   - These are explicitly ignored in NotificationProvider
   - No modal or alternative handling implemented

## Potential Improvements

### 1. Favor Response Modal
Create a modal at `/(modals)/favor-response.tsx` to handle:
- Favor accepted notifications
- Favor declined notifications  
- Favor completed notifications

Add to categoryRouteMapping:
```typescript
'favor_response': '/(modals)/favor-response',
```

### 2. Reaction Notifications
Currently reactions use 'default' category and are ignored. Could:
- Create a dedicated reaction modal
- Or integrate reactions into a general activity feed

### 3. Ping Response Handling
PING_RESPONSE events currently have no UI. Options:
- Create a simple modal to show the thank you
- Or keep as silent notification (current behavior)

### 4. Notification History/List
The notifications are stored in database but there's no UI to view history:
- Could add a notifications list screen
- Show read/unread status
- Allow revisiting past notifications

### 5. Rich Notification Content
Current implementation uses basic title/body. Could enhance with:
- Images in notifications
- Action buttons in notification preview
- Custom notification sounds per category

### 6. Notification Preferences
No user preferences for notifications:
- Could add per-category opt-in/opt-out
- Quiet hours settings
- Partner-specific notification settings

## Technical Debt

1. **Error Handling**: Limited error handling for malformed payloads or missing routes
2. **Testing**: No automated tests for notification routing logic
3. **Analytics**: No tracking of notification engagement metrics
4. **Performance**: No caching or optimization for frequently accessed notification data

## Conclusion

The core notification system refactor is complete and working well. The remaining items are mostly nice-to-have features or edge cases that don't impact the current user experience. The system is ready for production use and easily extensible for future notification types.
