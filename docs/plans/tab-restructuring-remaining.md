# Tab Restructuring - Remaining Implementation Tasks

This document outlines features from the original implementation plan that have not yet been implemented.

## Priority 1: Achievements System

### Database Implementation Needed
```sql
CREATE TABLE achievements (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  achievement_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  unlocked_at TIMESTAMP,
  progress INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  target INTEGER NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(user_id, achievement_type)
);
```

### Backend Logic Needed
- Database trigger to update achievement progress
- Background job to check and unlock achievements
- Notification system for achievement unlocks

### Current State
- Achievements are calculated on-the-fly in rewards.tsx
- No persistence between sessions
- No proper progress tracking
- Performance impact from recalculating every time

## Priority 2: Enhanced Activity Tab

### Summary Components Needed
```typescript
interface ActivitySummary {
  weeklyStats: {
    sent: number;
    received: number;
    streak: number;
    favorBalance: number;
  };
  insights: string[];
  milestones: Milestone[];
}
```

### Relationship Insights Needed
1. **Response Rate Calculation**
   - Track ping responses
   - Calculate average response time
   - Show improvement trends

2. **Activity Patterns**
   - Time of day analysis
   - Day of week patterns
   - Seasonal trends

3. **Balance Meter**
   - Giving vs receiving ratio
   - Favor exchange balance
   - Category preferences

### Smart Prompts Engine
- Detect inactivity (no events in X days)
- Suggest actions based on patterns
- Milestone reminders
- Partner preference hints

### Timeline Grouping
Current: Simple chronological list
Needed: Group by:
- Today
- Yesterday  
- This Week
- Last Week
- Older

With special markers for:
- Milestones reached
- Streak achievements
- High activity days

## Priority 3: Analytics Integration

### Current State
- Analytics is a separate screen under (more)
- Requires navigation through More tab

### Needed Implementation
1. **Profile Integration**
   - Expandable analytics section in profile
   - Quick stats summary
   - Tap to expand full analytics

2. **Deep Linking**
   - Update `/analytics` routes to `/profile?section=analytics`
   - Maintain backwards compatibility

## Priority 4: Additional Features

### Favor Balance Visualization
- Visual representation of favor economy
- Debt/credit indicator
- Historical balance chart

### Badge Evolution System
- Bronze → Silver → Gold progression
- Unlock criteria for each tier
- Visual upgrade animations

### Weekly Goals
- Set personal targets
- Progress tracking
- Completion rewards

### Export Features
- Memory book generation
- Analytics PDF export
- Badge collection sharing

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Database Foundation
1. Create achievements table
2. Add database triggers
3. Migrate existing calculated data

### Phase 2: Backend Services
1. Achievement calculation service
2. Notification integration
3. Progress tracking APIs

### Phase 3: UI Enhancements
1. Update Activity tab with new components
2. Integrate analytics into Profile
3. Add achievement notifications

### Phase 4: Polish
1. Animations and transitions
2. Performance optimizations
3. Error handling improvements

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **Performance**: Current achievement calculation is inefficient
2. **State Management**: No caching of achievement data
3. **Navigation**: Deep links need updating
4. **Testing**: No tests for achievement logic

## Migration Considerations

1. **Data Migration**: Calculate and store existing achievements
2. **Backwards Compatibility**: Ensure old routes still work
3. **Feature Flags**: Roll out gradually
4. **User Communication**: Notify about new features

## Success Metrics

1. **Engagement**: Increased daily active users
2. **Retention**: Higher week-over-week retention
3. **Feature Usage**: Track achievement views and shares
4. **Performance**: Faster load times with caching
