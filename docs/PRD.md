# Gratitude Bee - Product Requirements Document

**Last Updated: 2025-08-06**  
**Status: Production Implementation**

## 1. Introduction

**Gratitude Bee** is a mobile application designed for couples to strengthen their relationship by encouraging consistent, positive interactions and providing tools for healthy communication. The app gamifies appreciation, allowing partners to send and receive virtual badges for various positive actions, while also offering mechanisms for accountability and connection.

The core purpose is to build a "bank of goodwill" between partners, making gratitude a daily habit and providing a private, joyful space to celebrate the small things that make a relationship great.

## 2. Core Concepts

The application revolves around a few key concepts, detailed further in our [Points & Economy System](./PointsEconomy.md) documentation.

*   **Appreciation Badges:** Positive acknowledgments sent between partners. Each badge belongs to a category and carries a specific point value, which contributes to the receiver's category-specific **Appreciation Points** balance.
*   **Hornets (Negative Badges):** A tool for accountability. Sending a Hornet deducts a significant number of points from the receiver's **Hornet Stings** balance.
*   **Favors:** A system where partners can request help using **Favor Points**. The requester "spends" points, and the completer "earns" them, maintaining a balanced internal economy.
*   **Pings:** Urgent, non-verbal nudges. A small point value is awarded to the receiver upon responding, encouraging prompt communication.
*   **Message-Only Events:** Actions like "Don't Panic" and "Relationship Wisdom" are logged for timeline history but carry no point value.
*   **User Wallets:** Each user has a wallet that tracks their distinct point balances for Appreciations, Favors, and Hornets.
*   **Event Ledger:** Every interaction (badge sent, favor requested, etc.) is recorded as an immutable event in a central ledger. This provides a complete historical record, capturing who sent what to whom, when it happened, and any associated message or data. This ledger is the source of truth for the Timeline and all analytics.
*   **Dynamic Event Templates:** All badge, favor, and hornet types are defined in the database and manageable by an admin, allowing for dynamic content updates without requiring an app release.
*   **Push Notifications:** All significant partner interactions (new badges, favor requests, pings, etc.) trigger an immediate push notification to the receiving user's device to ensure timely communication.
*   **Real-time Chat:** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** - Partners can communicate through a private chat with typing indicators and online/offline status.
*   **Event Reactions:** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** - Users can react to received events with emojis.
